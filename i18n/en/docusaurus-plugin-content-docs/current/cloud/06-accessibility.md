## Accessibility Commitment

At IMS - Cloud, we are committed to making our infrastructure and services accessible to all users, including individuals with disabilities. Our goal is to ensure that every user, regardless of disability, can enjoy a comfortable, equal, and barrier-free experience.

## What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility refers to the ability of individuals with a wide range of disabilities, such as visual, hearing, motor, or learning impairments, to easily and comfortably use our online services. This accessibility includes the ability to access content, perform actions, and complete processes simply, using a user-friendly interface.

## Compliance with Standards

We operate according to the Israeli Standard for Web Accessibility (Standard 5568), based on the international guidelines of the W3C (WCAG 2.0). The standard is divided into three levels: A, AA, and AAA, and we strive to meet at least level AA for all our websites.

## Implemented Adjustments

1. Use of the "Nagish Li" plugin for website accessibility.
2. Keyboard support for all main functions on the website.
3. Integration of text enlargement and color adjustment options for individuals with visual impairments.
4. Support for alternative descriptions for images and texts for screen readers.
