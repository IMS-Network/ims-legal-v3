### 1. Introduction

This Acceptable Use Policy (as amended, modified, or added to from time to time as published on the IMS - Network website, this "AUP") of IMS - Network and its affiliates ("IMS - Network"), is designed to protect IMS - Network’s customers, users of IMS - Network's website, IMS - Network's products and services, and to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

If you do not agree with this AUP, please do not access, connect to, or use the website and/or any of the products and services.

This AUP applies to every customer subscribed to the products and services.

This AUP should be read in conjunction with the Terms, SLA, and Privacy Policy.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms, SLA, or Privacy Policy, as applicable.

The customer declares and warrants that they have read, understood, and accepted the provisions of the Terms, SLA, Privacy Policy, and this AUP.

By using the products and services, customers are responsible and will remain responsible for complying with the provisions of this AUP, including any violation attributable to their customers and users, whether or not authorized by the customer or IMS - Network. Customers must take all reasonable steps to ensure that their customers and users comply with this AUP.

This AUP does not (a) obligate IMS - Network to monitor, review, or patrol the data and content on IMS - Network’s servers and/or managed by the customer under their account, nor (b) create any obligation or liability on IMS - Network to any party other than the customer. It is the customer’s duty to notify IMS - Network of any legal violations or violations of this AUP.

IMS - Network explicitly disclaims all responsibility for data and content transmitted through or between IMS - Network, temporarily or permanently stored on any IMS - Network server, or through the use of the account and actions or omissions by customers and/or any of their customers or users.

In addition to any other action IMS - Network may take under this AUP, IMS - Network reserves the right to fully cooperate with any criminal investigation of data, information, or content located on IMS - Network's servers and/or used for illegal purposes through the use of the products and services.

### 2. Customer Security and Confidentiality Responsibilities

The customer is responsible for:
- (a) using reasonable care to secure their account;
- (b) maintaining the confidentiality of their password and account;
- (c) ensuring that all actions performed in connection with the account comply with the Terms, this AUP, and the relevant laws.

The customer acknowledges and agrees that IMS - Network is not responsible for the internal management or administration of the customer’s account and any data, content, and information stored therein.

The customer is solely responsible for any breach or security violation of any of their accounts unless such coverage is covered under a dedicated security management services package or firewall security service purchased by the customer from IMS - Network.

### 3. Prohibited Activities

#### A. Legal Violations

Customers must not allow the publication, transmission, or storage of data or content on or through the account and/or the products and services that, in IMS - Network’s sole discretion, violate any federal, state, local, or international law, regulation, court order, or other legal process ("Applicable Laws").

Customers operating mailing lists must maintain full and accurate records of all opt-in and confirmed opt-in consents and provide this documentation to IMS - Network upon request. If the customer cannot provide positive and verifiable proof of such consents and confirmed opt-ins, IMS - Network will consider the mailing list to be unsolicited. Any mailing list operated by the customer must allow any party on the list to automatically and permanently remove themselves.

Operating and maintaining IRC servers that connect to global IRC networks such as Undernet, EFnet, and DALnet. The use of IRC plugins, scripts, add-ons, clones, or other software intended to disrupt or deny service to other users is prohibited. Specifically, IRC activities that are disruptive or abusive are explicitly prohibited under this AUP, including (i) service disruptions or denial of service, or (ii) the use or participation in "botnets," or the use of IRC BNCs or other proxy software. If a customer's IRC servers are frequently compromised or attract denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt or prevent service to other customers or users, IMS - Network may null-route, filter, suspend, or terminate the customer's service.

Additionally, the operation of multiple accounts on the platform (whether within a specific brand or across multiple partners) is prohibited.

For clarity, all customer activities must at all times comply with all applicable laws, not offend any audience, and not harm any third party, while avoiding any deceptive, misleading, or unethical actions that could damage IMS - Network or any third party. The user warrants that services provided by IMS - Network will never be used by the user or any third party for activities that involve content that is: defamatory; obscene; slanderous; discriminatory; offensive; misleading; or otherwise harmful – including, but not limited to, the installation or distribution of any viruses, worms, bugs, Trojan horses, or other harmful or destructive code, files, or programs; violent material, including content promoting, encouraging, or engaging in terrorism, violence against individuals, animals, or property; child pornography or pedophilia, including content promoting or engaging in the exploitation of children; the sale or distribution of prescription drugs without authorization or regulation; illegal or unlawful gambling; or illegal or unauthorized activity.

### 4. Additional Restrictions and Prohibited Activities

In addition to the prohibited activities outlined in this AUP, and without limiting anything stated herein, the customer agrees not to:
- Store multiple copies of identical or substantially similar files.
- Use the products and services, or any IMS - Network servers, for backup purposes.
- Use the products and services for file transmission to a large number of users (megauploading), especially while using cloud file server services.

### 5. Customer Obligations

The customer must obtain and maintain all licenses, permits, and other approvals necessary to fulfill their obligations under the Terms, this AUP, and any applicable laws.

The customer agrees and acknowledges that all content and activities carried out through the account and/or the products and services are the customer's sole responsibility. Notwithstanding this, the customer acknowledges that although IMS - Network does not pre-screen the content used by the customer through the account and/or the products and services, IMS - Network reserves the right, but not the obligation, to remove or refuse to provide the products and services in the case of offensive content or as required by any legal authority, without compensation of any kind, financial or otherwise, to the customer. The customer agrees that they must evaluate and bear all risks associated with the use of any of their content and activities.

The customer must comply at all times with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, judgments, and relevant directives, as well as practices and procedures when carrying out their obligations hereunder.

The customer warrants that their engagement with IMS - Network for the receipt of products and services does not require the consent of any other person or entity. The user further warrants that at all times during the engagement with IMS - Network, all software, hardware, codes, algorithms, developments, and/or any other resources ("Technological Resources") used by the customer are either legally licensed by the customer from third parties and/or self-developed by the customer, and in any event, are used by the customer in compliance with this AUP and all applicable laws. For the avoidance of doubt, IMS - Network reserves the right, but not the obligation, to remove or refuse to provide the products and services in the event of illegal use of Technological Resources, without compensation of any kind, financial or otherwise, to the customer. The user agrees that they must evaluate and bear all risks associated with the use of their content and activities.

The customer agrees not to make any representations, promises, or guarantees to any third party regarding the specifications, features, or capabilities of the products and services provided by IMS - Network that are not consistent with the literature, protocols, training, explanations, and agreements provided by IMS - Network in writing to the customer.

### 6. Legal Investigations

Customers must cooperate with and promptly comply with any civil or criminal investigation regarding their use of the account and/or the products and services, including, without limitation, subpoenas, discovery requests, freeze orders, search warrants, information requests, wiretaps, electronic interceptions and surveillance, preservation requests, and any other legal orders from a court, government entity, or regulatory agency (each, an "Investigation"). IMS - Network may, at its sole discretion, charge the customer or any requesting party the reasonable costs and expenses associated with IMS - Network's compliance with any such Investigation. IMS - Network reserves the right to comply with any Investigation without notifying the customer. IMS - Network reserves the right to disclose information related to customers, their use of the account and/or the products and services, or any information sent, owned, or stored by or on behalf of any customer, if such information is disclosed in connection with an Investigation or to prevent death or physical harm to any person, as determined by IMS - Network at its sole discretion.
